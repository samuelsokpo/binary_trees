## Project Description:newspaper:

This is the last project with the languae C in the second quarter of Holberton about Binary trees, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

---

## General Objectives:bulb:

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

---

## Instalation:wrench:

Follow the following instructions to get a copy of the program and run in your local machine.

* Clone the following repository.
```
https://github.com/samisosa20/binary_trees.git
```

* Compile it with GCC
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -g *.c -o binary_tree
```

* Run the program
```
./binary_tree
```

* Run with debugger
```
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./binary_tree
```
---

## Tasks:clipboard:

### [0. New node]
* Write a function that creates a binary tree node.


### [1. Insert left]
* Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
